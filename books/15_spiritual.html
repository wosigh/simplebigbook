<div class="indent">Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the impression that these personality changes, or religious experiences, must be in the nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals. Happily for everyone, this conclusion is erroneous.</div>

<div class="indent">In the first few chapters a number of sudden revolutionary changes are described. Though it was not our intention to create such an impression, many alcoholics have nevertheless concluded that in order to recover they must acquire an immediate and overwhelming "God-consciousness" followed at once by a vast change in feeling and outlook.</div>

<div class="indent">Among our rapidly growing membership of thousands of alcoholics such transformations, though frequent, are by no means the rule.

<div class="indent">Most emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover, provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual concepts. He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial.</div>

<div class="indent">We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program. <i>Willingness, honesty and open mindedness are the essentials of recovery. But these are indispensable.</i></div>
