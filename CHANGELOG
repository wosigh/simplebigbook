* FIXED: ALL text formatting is consistent via CSS.
* FIXED: ALL Pages have over-hauled/consistent Look 'n' Feel.
* FIXED: App Menu is consistent throughout all scenes.

* ADDED: Remembers exactly where you were reading when closed for easy resuming.
* ADDED: Night/Dark color theme modes: More eye-pleasing in low light situations.

* ADDED: Find A Meeting: Not perfect, it does work.

* IMPROVED: Search is somewhat faster.  I found that the ENTIRE text (fulltext.html) was being loaded two or three times.  Memory/CPU waster!
* IMPROVED: Search logic is a bit faster due to change in format of fullscreen.html (the HTML fields are quoted now for EASY filtering).
* IMPROVED: Page load times a bit faster (due to cleaner HTML/CSS and general code clean up).
